EM64-ASM
---

Long term this will a EM64 compliant assembly encoder.

The goal is to seperate the _front end_ that hands CLI
args, flags, objectfiles, macho-o's, and coffs from
the backend that handles the details of how assmebly
gets converts into machine language. 

Progress is slow and changes are sweeping. I'm learning
about the platform as I'm writing.
